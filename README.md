### PathFinder Method

An iterative approach for SaaS ERP implementation focuses on delivering the ERP system in incremental stages, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation based on user feedback and evolving business needs. This approach reduces risks, accelerates time to value, and ensures that the ERP system is aligned with the organization’s goals throughout the implementation process. This methodology emphasizes incremental delivery, stakeholder engagement, and adaptability. The implementation is broken down into several iterations or cycles, each lasting typically 2-4 weeks, allowing for continuous improvements and feedback integration.

## Deployment Options

+ Private Cloud
    - NUNCHO ERP can be deployed in the cloud for a monthly/annual hosting fee. A Private Cloud deployment lowers IT infrastructure overhead and ensures access to data around-the-clock within a managed data centre. Private Cloud allows companies with remote sites to share the same Nuncho installation and data, enabling multi-site ERP software access. Costs of servers and other IT infrastructure needs are not included with Nuncho ERP software or implementation costs.

+ SaaS(Software-as-a-Service)
    - Software as a Service (SaaS) allows customers to subscribe to and use application software in the cloud rather than having to buy the hardware or license the software. You simply purchase ERP subscription from Nuncho Software for a monthly/Annual subscription fee and the service is delivered to you over the internet. A modern cloud suite provides complete software for your entire business so that you can subscribe to certain SaaS applications for your finance, supply chain, human resources, customer experience, sales, and marketing organizations.


## Pricing Options
