# Extensibility

In this repository you will find information and code samples that allows you to understand how to use PRIMAVERA extensibility technology. This technology is the Visual Basic For Applications successor.

###  Extensibility Principle

In a ERP, extensibility is a tool that allows you to change the application business workflow or add extra business rules to implement your unique business processes.
The key to extensibility is that you can develop pieces of code that best fit you customer business process and create the necessary functionality for themselves.

With extensibility tools, you can:
1) Add to a entity user-defined fields and user-defined tables.
2) Change or add business rules at the user interface or API level.
3) Add new items to the application menu.
4) Add a new tab to an existing windows/entities.

## Repository Organization

This repository is organized in two sections, in the section **samples** you will found code samples that will help you understand how to use  the extensibility technology. In the section **Implementation** you will found real case solution to specialized market areas.

# Role Based Access Control - User Management Microservice

#### Overview
>The need to manage a user base for an online system is very frequent.
Goal of this project is to offer a generic user's data management microservice.

This microservice can offer a good and solid starting point for managing your accounts.
Thanks to this Role Based Access Control implementation it's easy to define roles and permissions for your specific application/prototype and subsequently apply these access rules on the users.

This project lends itself very well to implement new prototypes or to create new solutions based on microservice architecture.

The solution is thought using the Docker technologies with two different containers:
* one Spring Boot REST Apis
* one MySql 8.0 database

The code has been well tested (> 115 tests) using JUnit and Mockito, H2 in memory database and some standard libraries for the integration tests.


If you're using this software or a part of it, please support this open source with a small donation here:

I'm not working at the moment... Thanks!

#### Exposed REST apis
Here below the most relevant features exposed using REST Apis:

#### User management features

* Register a new user account
* Login with username & password
* Retrieve a single user account
* Retrieve the list of all the existing user accounts
* Update user account data (basic user data, contacts, address)
* Add or remove a role on an user account
* Delete a user account
* Define secured accounts that cannot be deleted but only modified
* Standard validation for email, phone, password

#### RBAC features: manages roles and permissions

* Retrieve all the permissions
* Retrieve the list of the existing roles
* Create a new role
* Retrieve a single role
* Delete a role
* Add a permission on a role
* Remove a permission on a role

Dolibarr ERP & CRM is a modern software package that helps manage your organization's activity (contacts, suppliers, invoices, orders, stocks, agenda…).

It's an Open Source Software suite (written in PHP with optional JavaScript enhancements) designed for small, medium or large companies, foundations and freelancers.

You can freely use, study, modify or distribute it according to its licence.

You can use it as a standalone application or as a web application to access it from the Internet or a LAN.

## LICENSE

Dolibarr is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version (GPL-3+).

See the [COPYING](https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/blob/develop/COPYING) file for a full copy of the license.

Other licenses apply for some included dependencies. See [COPYRIGHT](https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/blob/develop/COPYRIGHT) for a full list.

## INSTALLING

### Simple setup

If you have low technical skills and you're looking to install Dolibarr ERP/CRM in just a few clicks, you can use one of the packaged versions:

- [DoliWamp for Windows](https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Dolibarr_for_Windows_DoliWamp)
- [DoliDeb for Debian](https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Dolibarr_for_Ubuntu_or_Debian)
- DoliRpm for Redhat, Fedora, OpenSuse, Mandriva or Mageia

Releases can be downloaded from [official website](https://www.dolibarr.org/).

### Advanced setup

You can use a web server and a supported database (MariaDB, MySQL or PostgreSQL) to install the standard version.

On GNU/Linux, first check if your distribution has already packaged Dolibarr.

#### Generic install steps

- Check that your installed PHP version is supported [see PHP support](https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Releases).

- Uncompress the downloaded .zip archive to copy the "dolibarr/htdocs" directory and all its files inside your web server root or get the files directly from GitHub (recommanded if you know git as it makes it easier if you want to upgrade later):

  `git clone https://github.com/dolibarr/dolibarr -b x.y`     (where x.y is main version like 3.6, 9.0, ...)

- Set up your web server to use "*dolibarr/htdocs*" as root if your web server does not have an already defined directory to point to.

- Create an empty `htdocs/conf/conf.php` file and set *write* permissions for your web server user (*write* permission will be removed once install is finished)

- From your browser, go to the dolibarr "install/" page

  The URL will depends on how you web setup was setup to point to your dolibarr installation. It may looks like:

  `http://localhost/dolibarr/htdocs/install/`

  or

  `http://localhost/dolibarr/install/`

  or

  `http://yourdolibarrvirtualhost/install/`

- Follow the installer instructions

### Saas/Cloud setup

If you don't have time to install it yourself, you can try some commercial 'ready to use' Cloud offers (See [https://saas.dolibarr.org](https://saas.dolibarr.org)). However, this third solution is not free.

## UPGRADING

Dolibarr supports upgrading, usually without the need for any (commercial) support (depending on if you use any commercial extensions). It supports upgrading all the way from any version after 2.8 without breakage. This is unique in the ERP ecosystem and a benefit our users highly appreciate!

- At first make a backup of your Dolibarr files & then [see](https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Installation_-_Upgrade#Upgrade_Dolibarr)
- Check that your installed PHP version is supported by the new version [see PHP support](./doc/phpmatrix.md).
- Overwrite all old files from 'dolibarr' directory with files provided into the new version's package.
- At first next access, Dolibarr will redirect you to the "install/" page to follow the upgrade process.
  If an `install.lock` file exists to lock any other upgrade process, the application will ask you to remove the file manually (you should find the `install.lock` file in the directory used to store generated and uploaded documents, in most cases, it is the directory called "*documents*").

'''BlueSeer ERP''' is a Free open source ERP software package.  It was designed to meet the needs of
the manufacturing community for an ERP system that is easily customizable and
extendable while providing generic functionality that is typically observed in
most manufacturing environments.  BlueSeer also provides a fully functional EDI mapping tool for EDI translations and file traffic monitoring. 
BlueSeer is released for free use under the MIT License.   The application and source code
are available for download at github.com.  The development of BlueSeer
began in 2005, and the latest 'stable' release of version 6.1 was released on March 21st 2022.</br>

<h1>Functionality</h1>

BlueSeer provides modules for the following generic set of business concepts : 
* Double Entry General Ledger
* Cost Accounting
* Accounts Receivable Processing and Aging
* Accounts Payable Processing and Aging
* PayRoll
* APIs for system to system integration
* Inventory Control
* Job Tracking
* Lot Traceability
* Order Management
* Service Order and Quoting Management
* Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
* UCC Label Generation
* Materials Resource Planning (MRP)
* Human Resources (HR)

<h2>Technology</h2>
BlueSeer ERP is written entirely in Java.  The application is a non-web based
desktop application that relies heavily on the Java Swing widget
toolkit/library.  There are currently two database engines available for
BlueSeer. 
For single client deployment, The relational database SQLite is used for
it's deployment ease and server-less design.  For multi-client
deployment scenarios, the open-source relational database MySQL is used as the
back-end database server.  MySQL was chosen for it's popularity and excellent
performance
reviews.  
</br>
BlueSeer is a menu-driven application.  It's composition is a collection of Java Swing
JPanel widgets.  Each business function, i.e. Order Entry, Item Master
Maintenance, etc is a stand-alone JPanel widget.  Each JPanel widget is loaded
at runtime using Reflection to 'inject' the JPanel
into the JFrame on user
demand.  JPanel class names are stored in the database and associated
with  menu options which are further associated with user permissions.  This
archtitecture increases the capability of customization and extension by
engaging BlueSeer as
a Desktop Application Framework.  Applications independent of the core
software can be quickly deployed 
given the menu/class management and
permissions functionality that's built into the BlueSeer framework.
</br>
